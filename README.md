## NASA-Daily

NASA Daily uses the NASA open source API to display an image or video from NASA that changes each day. This is very much still a work in progress, but working on it on my own time. Using React, Axios, Styled Components, and React YouTube on this.

I deployed this with Surge and will try to keep it updated, here's the link: http://nasa-daily.surge.sh/

Things to do:

* Better styling
* Fix CSS border on scroll down
* Better format of data
* UX decision - display explanation?
* Touch up VideoPage
* Include Redux to better manage data?

I'm also open to any suggestions, pull requests, or working with issues!
